/**
 * Abstract Controller class for RESTful controller mapping. Supports GET, PUT,
 * POST, and DELETE. By default, these methods will be mapped to these actions:
 *
 * GET
 * :  Mapped to the "index" action, lists all objects
 *
 * POST
 * :  Mapped to the "create" action, creates a new object
 *
 * PUT
 * :  Mapped to the "update" action, update an existing object
 *
 * DELETE
 * :  Mapped to the "delete" action, delete an existing object
 *
 * Additional methods can be supported by adding the method and action to
 * the `$_action_map` property.
 *
 * [!!] Using this class within a website will require heavy modification,
 * due to most web browsers only supporting the GET and POST methods.
 * Generally, this class should only be used for web services and APIs.
