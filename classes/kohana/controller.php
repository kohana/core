 * Abstract controller class. Controllers should only be created using a [Request].
 *
 * Controllers methods will be automatically called in the following order by
 * the request:
 *
 *     $controller = new Controller_Foo($request);
 *     $controller->before();
 *     $controller->action_bar();
 *     $controller->after();
 *
 * The controller action should add the output it creates to
 * `$this->response->body($output)`, typically in the form of a [View], during the
 * "action" part of execution.
