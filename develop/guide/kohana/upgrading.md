# Migrating from 3.0.x

## Config

The configuration system has been rewritten to make it more flexible. The most significant change is that config 
groups are now merged across all readers, similar to how files cascade within the cascading filesystem. Therefore 
you can now override a single config value (perhaps a database connection string, or a 'send-from' email address)
and store it in a separate config source (environment config file / database / custom) while inheriting the 
remaining settings from that group from your application's configuration files.

In other respects, the majority of the public API should still operate in the same way, however the one major change
is the transition from using `Kohana::config()` to `Kohana::$config->load()`, where `Kohana::$config` is an instance
of `Config`.

`Config::load()` works almost identically to `Kohana::config()`, e.g.:

	Kohana::$config->load('dot.notation')
	Kohana::$config->load('dot')->notation

A simple find/replace for `Kohana::config`/`Kohana::$config->load` within your project should fix this.

The terminology for config sources has also changed.  Pre 3.2 config was loaded from "Config Readers" which both
read and wrote config.  In 3.2 there are **Config Readers** and **Config Writers**, both of which are a type of 
**Config Source**.

A **Config Reader** is implemented by implementing the `Kohana_Config_Reader` interface; similarly a **Config Writer**
is implemented by implementing the `Kohana_Config_Writer` interface.

e.g. for Database:

	class Kohana_Config_Database_Reader implements Kohana_Config_Reader
	class Kohana_Config_Database_Writer extends Kohana_Config_Database_Reader implements Kohana_Config_Writer

Although not enforced, the convention is that writers extend config readers.

To help maintain backwards compatability when loading config sources empty classes are provided for the db/file sources
which extends the source's reader/writer.

e.g.

	class Kohana_Config_File extends Kohana_Config_File_Reader
	class Kohana_Config_Database extends Kohana_Config_Database_Writer

## Request/Response

The request class has been split into a request and response class. To set the response body, you used to do:

	$this->request->response = 'foo';

This has changed to:

	$this->response->body('foo');

Some properties that existed in the request class have been converted into methods:

	- Request::$controller -> Request::controller()
	- Request::$action -> Request::action()
	- Request::$directory -> Request::directory()
	- Request::$uri -> Request::uri()

Request::instance() has been replaced by Request::current() and Request::initial(). Normally you'll want to use Request::current(), but if you are sure you want the *original* request (when running hmvc requests), use Request::initial().

### External requests in Kohana 3.2

In Kohana 3.2, `Request_Client_External` now has three separate drivers to handle external requests;

 - `Request_Client_Curl` is the default driver, using the PHP Curl extension
 - `Request_Client_HTTP` uses the PECL HTTP extension
 - `Request_Client_Stream` uses streams native to PHP and requires no extensions. However this method is slower than the alternatives.

Unless otherwise specified, `Request_Client_Curl` will be used for all external requests. This can be changed for all external requests, or for individual requests.

To set an external driver across all requests, add the following to the `application/bootstrap.php` file;

    // Set all external requests to use PECL HTTP
    Request_Client_External::$client = 'Request_Client_HTTP';

Alternatively it is possible to set a specific client to an individual Request.

    // Set the Stream client to an individual request and
    // Execute
    $response = Request::factory('http://kohanaframework.org')
        ->client(new Request_Client_Stream)
        ->execute();

### HTTP cache control in 3.2

Kohana 3.1 introduced HTTP cache control, providing RFC 2616 fully complient transparent caching of responses. Kohana 3.2 builds on this moving all caching logic out of `Request_Client` into `HTTP_Cache`.

[!!] HTTP Cache requires the Cache module to be enabled in all versions of Kohana!

In Kohana 3.1, HTTP caching is enabled doing the following;

    // Apply cache to a request
    $request = Request::factory('foo/bar', Cache::instance('memcache'));

    // In controller, ensure response sets cache control,
    // this will cache the response for one hour
    $this->response->headers('cache-control', 
        'public, max-age=3600');

In Kohana 3.2, HTTP caching is enabled slightly differently;

    // Apply cache to request
    $request = Request::factory('foo/bar',
        HTTP_Cache::factory(array(), 'memcache'));

    // In controller, ensure response sets cache control,
    // this will cache the response for one hour
    $this->response->headers('cache-control', 
        'public, max-age=3600');

## Validation

The validation class has been improved to include "context" support. Because of this, the api has changed. Also, The class has been split: core validation logic is now separate from built-in validation rules. The new core class is called `Validation` and the rules are located in the `Valid` class.

### Context

The validation class now contains "context" support. This allowed us to merge the rule() and callback() methods, and there is now simply a rule() method that handles both cases.

Old usage:

	rule('password', 'matches', array('repeat_password'))

New usage:

	rule('password', 'matches', array(':validation', 'password', 'repeat_password'))

The third parameter now contains all parameters that get passed to the rule. If you look at Valid::matches(), you'll see:

	public static function matches($array, $field, $match)

:validation is the first parameter, 'password' is the second (the field we want to check) and 'repeat_password' is the third (what we want to match)

:validation is a special "context" variable that tells the Validation class to replace with the actual validation class. You can see in this way, the matches rule is no different than how callbacks used to work, yet are more powerful. There are other context variables:

 - :validation - The validation object
 - :field - The field being compared (rule('username', 'min_length', array(':field', 4)))
 - :value - The value of the field

You can use any php function as a rule if it returns a boolean value.

### Filters

Filters have been removed from the validation class. There is no specific replacement. If you were using it with ORM, there is a new mechanism for filtering in that module.

## Cookie salts

The cookie class now throws an exception if there isn't a salt set, and no salt is the now the default. You'll need to make sure you set the salt in your bootstrap:

	Cookie::$salt = 'foobar';

Or define an extended cookie class in your application:

	class Cookie extends Kohana_Cookie
	{
		public static $salt = 'foobar';
	}

## Controller constructor

If for some reason you are overloading your controller's constructor, it has changed to:

	public function __construct(Request $request, Response $response)

## index.php / bootstrap.php changes

The main change here is that the request execution has been removed from bootstrap.php and moved to index.php. This allows you to use one bootstrap when doing testing. The reason for this change is that the bootstrap should only setup the environment. It shouldn't run it.

## 404 Handling

Kohana now has built in exception support for 404 and other http status codes. If you were using ReflectionException to detect 404s, you should be using HTTP_Exception_404 instead. For details on how to handle 404s, see [error handling](errors).

## Form Class

If you used Form::open(), the default behavior has changed. It used to default to the current URI, but now an empty parameter will default to "/" (your home page).

## Logging

The log message level constants now belong to the Log class.  If you are referencing those constants to invoke Kohana::$log->add( ... ) you will need to change the following:

    - Kohana::ERROR -> Log::ERROR
    - Kohana::DEBUG -> Log::DEBUG
    - Kohana::INFO  -> Log::INFO
