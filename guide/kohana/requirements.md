# Basic Requirements

Kohana will run in almost any environment with minimal configuration. There are a few minimum server requirements:

1. Server with [Unicode](http://unicode.org/) support.
2. [PHP](http://php.net) version >= 5.2.3
3. An HTTP server. Kohana is known to work with: Apache 1.3+, Apache 2.0+, lighttpd, and MS IIS.

Optionally, if you wish to use a database with Kohana, you will need a database server. There are database drivers for [MySQL](../database/config#mysql) and [PDO](../database/config#pdo). but new drivers can be made for other database servers.
